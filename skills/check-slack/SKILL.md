# Check Slack

Check for unread Slack DMs and @mentions, summarize what needs attention, and text me if there's anything important.

## Workflow

1. Use the `slack-unread` skill to fetch recent DMs and @mentions (default: last 24 hours)
2. Evaluate importance of each message
3. If there are important items, send a text via `mcp__sms__send_sms` with a concise summary

## Importance rules

**Always important** (text me):
- Direct questions from coworkers (not bots)
- @mentions asking for help, review, or input
- Messages with urgency indicators ("urgent", "asap", "blocking", "blocker", "help")
- Messages from leadership or cross-team requests

**Not important** (skip):
- Bot notifications (GitHub, Linear, Geekbot, etc.)
- FYI-only mentions (no action needed)
- Messages I've likely already seen (if I replied in the same thread)
- Messages older than the time window

## Text format

Keep the SMS concise. Example:

```
Slack check:
- @rem in #proj-finops-agent asking for help with a conversation (2:09 PM)
- @andy DM'd about PR review approach (1:33 PM)
```

If nothing important, do NOT send a text. Just report back that everything's clear.

## Notes

- This skill composes `slack-unread` for data and `mcp__sms__send_sms` for notifications
- Use judgment on importance — err on the side of notifying for genuine human requests
- Always tell the user what you found, even if nothing was important enough to text about
