# Slack Unread

Check for recent Slack DMs and @mentions using the Slack search API.

## Auth

Use the user token from `/Users/tyler/repos/barry/.env`:

```bash
source /Users/tyler/repos/barry/.env
# Use $SLACK_USER_TOKEN for search queries
```

Tyler's Slack user ID: `U082DC1UR99`

## Queries

### 1. Recent DMs (from humans, not bots)

Search for DMs sent to me, excluding my own messages. Filter out known bot usernames: `github`, `barry`, `geekbot standup, poll & survey`, `slackbot`, `linear`.

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_USER_TOKEN" \
  "https://slack.com/api/search.messages?query=to%3Ame+-from%3Ame+in%3Aim&sort=timestamp&sort_dir=desc&count=20"
```

Post-filter: remove messages where `username` matches a known bot name or where `text` is empty.

### 2. @mentions in channels

Search for messages that mention me by user ID, excluding my own messages and the `#engineering-github` channel (too noisy with automated PR mentions).

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_USER_TOKEN" \
  "https://slack.com/api/search.messages?query=%3C%40U082DC1UR99%3E+-from%3Ame+-in%3Aengineering-github&sort=timestamp&sort_dir=desc&count=20"
```

## Output format

Return two lists:

**DMs** — recent DMs from real people:
```
- [time] from @username: message preview (truncated to ~100 chars)
```

**Mentions** — recent @mentions in channels:
```
- [time] @username in #channel: message preview (truncated to ~100 chars)
```

## Time window

Default: last 24 hours. Filter results by comparing the message `ts` (unix timestamp) against the current time. Discard anything older than the window.

## Notes

- The search API returns all-time results sorted by recency. Always filter by time window client-side.
- Bot messages in DMs (github, geekbot, linear, etc.) should be filtered out — they're noise.
- Empty `text` fields (common with GitHub bot messages) should be skipped.
- This skill is a data-fetching primitive. Use `check-slack` for the full workflow with notifications.
