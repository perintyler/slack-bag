# slack-app

The **inbound** Slack app: the Slack platform delivers events, slash commands,
and @barry mentions here, and they become Barry sessions. The **outbound**
direction — tools an agent calls to post and search — is the separate `slack`
bag (`~/repos/bags/slack`). Same split as `github-app` (inbound webhook
receiver) vs the `git` tools bag.

The bag declares one service, `events`, on port **4863** — the port is part
of the deployment's external contract (the tunnel fronting Slack's deliveries
points at it, and the `slack` tools bag's mentions lookup resolves this
service from the bag resource registry).

## Credential model: deploy-scoped today, per-barry when it matters

`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` / `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` are read from the service's env
(sourced from `.env` at install), and they are **allowlisted** in the
monorepo's bags-secrets policy. That is a deliberate decision, not an
oversight:

- There is exactly **one Slack app in one workspace per deploy**. The signing
  secret verifies that a request came from that app — it is infrastructure
  identity, like `BARRY_SECRET`, not a per-barry capability.
- Signature verification must happen **before** any tenant is known: the
  team/user in a payload can't be trusted until the signature checks out, so
  the verifying secret cannot itself be tenant-resolved.

### What per-barry resolution looks like (the github-app model)

`github-app` is the template: an inbound delivery carries an installation id,
the receiver maps installation → barry, and resolves that barry's credentials
per delivery (`resolveIdentityCredentials`), falling back to deploy env only
for unclaimed installations. The Slack equivalent, when more than one
workspace or app matters:

1. **Tenant key**: `team_id` from the (signature-verified) payload. A
   `slack_installations` mapping (team_id → barry id, bot token ref) replaces
   the single ambient `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`; tokens live in each barry's
   env/vault, resolved per delivery.
2. **Signing secrets**: one per Slack *app*, not per workspace — a
   multi-workspace single app keeps one secret; only a multi-*app* deploy
   needs a keyed lookup by the request's app id before verification.
3. **Session attribution**: `resolve.ts` already picks the barry for a
   delivery; it would read the installation mapping instead of defaulting.
4. **Policy**: the `SLACK_*` entries come OUT of the monorepo-policy
   allowlist, which is what makes regressions impossible to miss.

Until a second workspace exists, the mapping table would have one row and the
refactor would be indirection with no tenant to serve — so it waits.
